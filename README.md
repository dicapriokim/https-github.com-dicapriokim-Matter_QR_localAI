- **Local AI Engine (Ollama)**: Advanced reasoning using `antigravity-model:3b` for intelligent device naming and OCR error correction.
- **Modular Architecture**: Optimized modular structure (`state.js`, `ui.js`, `ai.js`, `scanner.js`) for high performance and maintainability.
- **Dual Storage Vault**: Redundant saving system via HA Backend API and Browser `localStorage`.

## 📖 Quick Start Guide (v3.2.9)

### 1. Initial Setup
Before adding devices, configure your ecosystem in the **[Settings ⚙️]** menu to ensure data consistency:
- **Locations**: Living Room, Bedroom, Entrance, etc.
- **Manufacturers**: Aqara, Eve, Nanoleaf, etc.
- **Platforms**: Apple Home, SmartThings, Home Assistant, etc.

### 2. Smart Registration & AI
Click the **[+]** button to add a new device.
- **AI Recommendation**: Click the 'Magic Wand' icon for AI-generated device names.
- **Fallback Logic**: If QR scanning fails to extract the pairing code, the system automatically uses OCR data as a backup.
- **Slashed Zero (0) Correction**: The AI is specifically tuned to distinguish between slashed zeros '0' and the digit '8' in pairing codes.

## ⚙️ Configuration (AI Proxy)

This add-on features a built-in **Backend AI Proxy** to enable stable communication with local AI servers in HTTPS environments.
1. **Ollama Server**: Ensure your server is running at `http://192.168.0.32:11434`.
2. **Required Models**:
   - `moondream` (Vision Pass)
   - `antigravity-model:3b` (Reasoning Pass)
3. **Internal Routing**: Requests are proxied via `api/ai` to bypass browser Mixed Content and CORS restrictions.

> **Note**: Core features (registration, backup, label printing) work perfectly even without an AI server.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Data Safety**: Data is stored at `/data/matter_data.json`. Always export a JSON backup before deleting the add-on to prevent data loss.
- **Camera Access**: Requires **HTTPS** or **localhost** due to browser security policies. For HTTP access, use the 'Photo Upload' feature.
- **Integrity Check**: Unauthorized modification of core files will trigger a security alert, disabling the app.
