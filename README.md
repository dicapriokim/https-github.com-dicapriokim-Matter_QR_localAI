## ⚙️ Configuration

To enable AI features, ensure your **Ollama** server is running:
1. Default URL: `http://192.168.0.32:11434` (configurable in `state.js`).

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Data Safety**: Data is stored at `/data/matter_data.json`. Always export a JSON backup before deleting the add-on to prevent data loss.
- **Camera Access**: Requires **HTTPS** or **localhost** due to browser security policies. For HTTP access, use the 'Photo Upload' feature.
- **Integrity Check**: Unauthorized modification of core files will trigger a security alert, disabling the app.
